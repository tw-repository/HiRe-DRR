Please refer to the "environment.txt".

## Dataset
[NoXi](https://multimediate-challenge.org/datasets/Dataset_NoXi/) was released by [[Angelo et al. ICMI 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3136755.3136780?casa_token=8UoDP_iZs3gAAAAA:mYUOHpnezNatC2FQpxXXur2Y8CWiKmS_2Jech1yxEp-XcBU9OsrgC6li0zdN5Up9ornfGimLOv4)].

WACV 2021](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021W/HBU/html/Palmero_Context-Aware_Personality_Inference_in_Dyadic_Scenarios_Introducing_the_UDIVA_Dataset_WACVW_2021_paper.html)]. It involves 2 relationships: Unknown and Known.

[Seamless Interaction](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_interaction) was released by [[Vasu Agrawal et al. 2025](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/seamless-interaction-dyadic-audiovisual-motion-modeling-and-large-scale-dataset/)]. 5 relationships used in this study: Stranger, Acquaintance, Friend, Family and Couple.
